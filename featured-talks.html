					<p>Many teams follow a linear design process with a big reveal&#8212;ta-da!&#8212;once the aesthetics, layout, and flow are &#8220;ready&#8221; for client&nbsp;feedback.</p>

					<p>Weeks later, the front-end developer enters to turn an approved design into a responsive site that functions perfectly across&nbsp;devices.</p>

					<p>Now imagine showing clients your work in Week 1. How would everyone respond to unpolished&nbsp;designs?</p>

					<p>Find out from Ben Callahan. In this talk, he&#8217;ll describe how&nbsp;to:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Improvise solutions&#8212;and make it a habit&#8212;right out of the&nbsp;gate</li>
						<li>Focus on the people involved, rather than the process&nbsp;itself</li>
						<li>Solve problems in whatever medium you&#8217;re most comfortable&nbsp;using</li>
						<li>Make refinements at the very end using HTML, CSS, and&nbsp;JavaScript</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Ben learned all of this when he and his company, Sparkbox, stopped designing deliverables and, instead, focused on the&nbsp;end-product.</p>

					<p>And after years of trying to discover The Perfect Process that optimizes budgets and skills, he&#8217;s finally learned a secret: there is no such&nbsp;thing.</p>

					<img src="assets/images/speakers/cyd-harrell.jpg" alt="Photo of Cyd Harrell" class="headshot">
					<p>Mobile phones are like research platforms in our pockets. With the right strategy, we can quickly understand our users&#8217; behavior, wherever they&nbsp;are.</p>

					<p>And given the ubiquity of mobile usage &#8212; even among hard-to-reach populations &#8212; we as UX designers are especially poised to make our lives easier while designing better&nbsp;products.</p>

					<p>That is, if we actually <em>do</em> the&nbsp;research.</p>

					<p>Fortunately, Cyd Harrell knows how to gather data without breaking budgets or extending&nbsp;timelines.</p>

					<p>In this talk, you&#8217;ll hear how&nbsp;to:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Choose the right mobile methods to answer deeper UX&nbsp;questions</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Set up a diary study, experience sample, and SMS and voice-based&nbsp;survey</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Identify physical space triggers, and use them to gather more user&nbsp;data</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Build research into your process without breaking the&nbsp;bank</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Cyd&#8217;s been doing remote research since 2007 while at Bolt | Peters. She even developed methods to broadcast remote research sessions to observation teams. Today, as the UX lead for Code for America, Cyd regularly performs research on mobile
						phones from low-income residents through smartphone-happy elite&nbsp;populations.</p>

					<p>In short, she&#8217;s The Expert. So don&#8217;t miss&nbsp;her.</p>

					<img src="assets/images/speakers/brad-frost.jpg" alt="Photo of Brad Frost" class="headshot">
					<p>Have you seen style tiles, element collages, or pattern libraries? These are just a few examples of how designers are reacting to the explosion of devices and interface&nbsp;sizes.</p>

					<p>After all, thinking about the parts of a &#8220;page&#8221;&#8212;not just the sum of those parts&#8212;helps us create smart, scalable, maintainable designs for all those newfangled&nbsp;technologies.</p>

					<p>And a leading voice behind this elemental thinking is Brad&nbsp;Frost.</p>

					<p>In this talk, he&#8217;ll introduce Atomic Design, a methodology you can use to create a design system in your organization. You&#8217;ll learn how&nbsp;to:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Deconstruct your organizations&#8217;&nbsp;interfaces</li>
						<li>Create systems that includes templates, and&nbsp;pages</li>
						<li>Create designs that are future-friendly and&nbsp;extensible</li>
						<li>Establish a repeatable workflow tailored to your team and&nbsp;product</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Whenever you read TechCrunch or Entertainment Weekly online, you&#8217;re looking at Brad&#8217;s Atomic Design work. He follows the methodology so regularly that he created a free tool called Pattern Lab that helps you create your own design&nbsp;systems.</p>

					<p>So if words like &#8220;future-friendly&#8221; and &#8220;flexibility&#8221; are requirements in your work, then don&#8217;t miss this&nbsp;talk.</p>

								<h3>Choosing Which Mobile Experience to&nbsp;Build</h3>

						</div>
					</div>
					<img src="assets/images/speakers/nate-schutta.jpg" alt="Photo of Nate Schutta" class="headshot">
					<p>By now, companies know they need to be “on mobile.” But should that experience be a native app, a mobile web app, or something in&nbsp;between?</p>

					<p>The answer rarely is such a simple choice. And if you’ve ever entered into mobile discussions with a series of stakeholders, it may seem impossible to reach&nbsp;consensus.</p>

					<p>Fortunately, Nate knows the business questions to ask, device constraints to consider, and UX trends for mobile that will help your company find its&nbsp;way.</p>

					<p>In this talk,&nbsp;you’ll:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Find out why mobile is something your company can’t afford to&nbsp;ignore</li>
						<li>Hear the pros and cons of various approaches, including the implications of each </li>
						<li>Get key mobile stats that will give your team fuel to make better, faster UX&nbsp;choices</li>
						<li>Learn which questions to ask stakeholders &#8212; ones they’ll actually be able to&nbsp;answer</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Nate is an architect who specializes in coaching teams as they build mobile user experiences. He’s among our industry’s foremost thinkers and communicators, and he knows how to help people make decisions about mobile UX. (In fact, he’s become so
						skilled at it that he’s part of a working group tasked with answering mobile-UX questions for his entire organization.) Don’t miss out on this&nbsp;one.</p>

								<h3>Adapting to Different Forms of&nbsp;Input</h3>
								<h4>Jason Grigsby</h4>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<img src="assets/images/speakers/jason-grigsby.jpg" alt="Photo of Jason Grigsby" class="headshot">
					<p>For years, we treated the web as if it was a fixed canvas. It took the iPhone and Ethan Marcotte&#8217;s article on Responsive Web Design for us to realize how dynamic the UI could&nbsp;be.</p>

					<p>But in addition to keyboards, we now have touch screens, cameras, voice control, and sensors as different kinds of inputs. Plus, we can&#8217;t know which inputs the user prefers to use until after we&#8217;ve tried designing with&#8212;and for&#8212;those&nbsp;inputs.</p>

					<p>So how do we design for all of the explosion of these dynamic&nbsp;inputs?</p>

					<p>Jason Grigsby has some ideas you&#8217;ll want to hear. Find out&nbsp;why:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>There is no connection between form factor and input </li>
						<li>We can&#8217;t detect input until someone uses it </li>
						<li>Aiming for &#8220;touch&#8221; as the input is a good starting point </li>
						<li>Designing for user needs and usage works across form&nbsp;factors</li>
					</ul>

					<p>And you couldn&#8217;t be learning from a more passionate, experienced&nbsp;teacher.</p>

					<p>Jason has a unique background in researching TV interface design and working in JavaScript frameworks for responsive apps. As a result, he realized there was a fundamental problem in designing for a multi-input world&#8212;one that he&#8217;s at
						the forefront of talking&nbsp;about.</p>

					<p>So if you&#8217;re ready for some Thanksgiving-sized brain food, then don&#8217;t miss his&nbsp;talk.</p>

					<img src="assets/images/speakers/karen-mcgrane.jpg" alt="Photo of Karen McGrane" class="headshot">
					<p>In 2015, more people worldwide will use a mobile device to access the internet than a traditional computer. Today, 33 percent of people in the United States only use a mobile device to browse&nbsp;online.</p>

					<p>Clearly, mobile isn&#8217;t just a new technology with a small screen size &#8212; it&#8217;s the way the world is getting&nbsp;online.</p>

					<p>So why are companies approaching mobile content from a desktop&nbsp;perspective?</p>

					<p>It&#8217;s time to define a mobile content strategy that will make your customers very happy. And Karen McGrane is your&nbsp;guide.</p>

					<p>In this talk, you&#8217;ll hear how&nbsp;to:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Identify what content you want to publish on mobile versus&nbsp;desktop</li>
						<li>Create an editorial workflow that&#8217;s realistic for your team and&nbsp;CMS</li>
						<li>Edit content to make it easier to read on all&nbsp;devices</li>
						<li>Add structure to your content to make it more&nbsp;flexible</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Companies including AT&amp;T, Aquent, Hearst, Lexmark, Marriott, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and T Rowe Price all called Karen to help them through this exact conundrum. After all, she wrote the book on Content Strategy for&nbsp;Mobile.</p>

							<p>What&#8217;s going to make your whole company focus on mobile? How do people interact with their mobiles device? How can you design for this new reality and even create experiences that translate from mobile to laptop to&nbsp;TV?</p>

							<p>Find out from Luke Wroblewski. He’s got the facts, tips, and case studies to help you talk confidently with your team about designing intuitive, cross-device experiences. You’ll think about how people are using your designs on mobile, whether browsing
								a content-heavy site or interacting with an e-commerce&nbsp;application.</p>

							<p>Luke’s talks are chock full of the tools and talking points to help design teams make great mobile UX decisions. In fact, you’ll see examples from his new product, <a href="http://www.polarb.com/">Polar</a>, a mobile product he created after Twitter
								acquired his prior startup, Bagcheck, just nine months after being launched&nbsp;publicly.</p>

							<img src="assets/images/speakers/jared-spool.jpg" alt="Photo of Jared Spool" class="headshot">
							<p>Why don’t design students coming out of school know about responsive design or creating mobile apps? Why are our self-taught hackers and C.S. grads having a tough time keeping up with the pace of technology&nbsp;innovation?</p>

							<p>It’s not that schools or professional development programs are slow to adapt; it’s more complicated than that. But our tendency to focus on skills alone just isn’t&nbsp;sustainable.</p>

							<p>Instead, we need to start investing in the ways we create designers and fuel their&nbsp;growth.</p>

							<p>Doing just that takes a combination of practical education, soft-skill development, and a commitment to lifelong learning. And in this talk, Jared Spool will dig into all three so you can be a part of developing the next generation of&nbsp;designers.</p>

							<p>This vital topic was the focus of <a href="http://unicorninstitute.com/">a multi-year research program</a> Jared conducted with Dr. Leslie Jensen-Inman to identify how orgs educate, hire, train, and develop designers. Armed with huge amounts of
								data, the duo then designed and launched Center Centre, a bricks-and-mortar school that cultivates industry-ready UX&nbsp;designers.</p>

							<p>So if you’ve ever wished there was a better system to support design thinkers like you, then this is your talk. After all, you could be part of defining the ideal&nbsp;solution.</p>
